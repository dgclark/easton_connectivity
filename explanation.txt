Columns are ROIs (clusters defined on anatomical x, y, z coordinates)
and each row is an individual from the study.
The first three columns are different, though:
first is subject ID,
second is diagnosis (consider aami to be the same as nc),
and third is conversion status — 0 if the person did not develop dementia during the study period, 1 if he did.

The first step:
1. bootstrap correlations for all ROIs using only the normal controls (nc and aami).
2. Then we can identify which ROIs are “connected” in the normal population.

The second step:
1. look at which variables mediate the relationships between those same ROIs in the mci group.
I think for that we may use a permutation analysis, unless you can think of a superior (?Bayesian) way to do it.
